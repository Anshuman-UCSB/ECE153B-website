Hello world!  

This is our first update for the project so far. We have currently set up the website, finished our project proposal, and ordered the parts from amazon. The total for the parts came out to ~30 dollars, not including board or build components/wires.  

The webpage is hosted on github sites, and uses Jekyll for the handling of the frontend. We found a nice theme and modified it for our intents and purposes, and we are happy with how it turned out!
