Bluetooth UART protocol working

This week we have successfully connected the bluetooth module to our board using UART so we can now control the game modes and input commands from our phone. 

We have also implemented the RNG peripheral so the game will always display the lights in a random order.

We also started working on the OLED display. We are able to send command registers but are having issues with sending data registers.
