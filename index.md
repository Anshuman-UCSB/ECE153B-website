# Overview
The fastest way to tire out a dog is through mental exercise, as dogs are not build for thinking. In an
attempt to tire out Anshuman’s pug Hash, our project will challenge Hash’s pattern recognition. We
intend to have 5 LED buttons, which will light up in various patterns. If Hash can press the buttons
in the correct order, a motor attached to a box with treats will dispense some as a reward. An on
board display will track his progress, including how many times he is successfully able to follow the
pattern. The game can be enabled or disabled remotely through a Bluetooth module.
